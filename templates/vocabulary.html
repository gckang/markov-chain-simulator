        Typically what is studied in linear algebra is right eigenvectors i.e. eigenvectors that satisfy

        $$P \pi = k \pi$$

        for some \(k \in \mathbb{R}\). As the study of Markov Chains typically uses \(P(x, y)\) to denote \(P(X_{t+1} = y | X_t = x)\) we will instead study left eigenvectors. As expected these will satisfy

        $$\pi P = k \pi$$

        For any classes \(x, y\)$ in a Markov Chain we say that \(x\)and \(y\) communicate if \(\exists n, m \geq 0\) s.t. \(P^n(x, y) > 0\) and \(P^k(y, x) > 0\). In plain english, two classes communicate if we can (possibly indirectly) go from one to the other. We leave it as an exercise to the reader that this forms an equivalence relation and we call the corresponding paritions <b>communication classes</b>. If a state \(x\) can travel to another state \(y\) but from \(y\) we cannot travel to \(x\) then we call \(x\) a <b>transient</b> state. If a state is not transient then we call it a <b>recurrent</b> state. In plain english, states are transient if there's a chance we never return and states are recurrent if we will always return to it. We leave it as another exercise to the reader to verify that transience and recurrence are shared among all members of a communication class.

        Lastly we introduce the concept of <b>periodicity</b>. Formally the period of a state \(x\) is 

        $$\textup{gcd}\{n \geq 1 | P^n(x, x) > 0\}$$

        i.e. the greatest common divisor of all the possible times we can return to a state. If the period of a state is 1 we call it <b>aperiodic</b>. If
